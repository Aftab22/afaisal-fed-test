## Description of my solution

* Redux -For managing the user list and adding more users to user list.
* Redux-Thunk - For updating state asynchronously.
* React-Router - For multi page behaviour.


## Things I would do next

* SCSS -  Move to scss for cleanliness.
* Unit testing - Add jest unit testing.
*

## Assumptions that I made

I only had a few hours to complete this due to other commitments. Would do better if i had more time.
Hoping to hear back from you.

Requesting feedback on my code. To improve myself.
